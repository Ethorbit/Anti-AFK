# Anti-AFK
A configurable program that executes buttons and moves your mouse when you are inactive to trick AFK punishing systems into thinking that you are active when you actually aren't. 

Anti-AFK can detect when you're inactive for the window even if you are alt tabbed doing stuff in the background and can still apply activity in it.
