# Anti-AFK
Anti-AFK is a completely external program that can execute buttons and move your mouse when you are inactive to fool systems that check for inactivity. 

Anti-AFK can detect when you're inactive for the selected window even if you are alt tabbed doing stuff in the background and can still apply activity in it. 

While there is no guarantee that Anti-AFK is Anti-Cheat proof, it is guaranteed that keyboard and mouse inputs will seem natural and will look like someone did them manually.

## Customization:
#### Anti-AFK is highly customizable and you are able to change:
* The time it takes for Anti-AFK to deem you as inactive
* The interval to apply activity at when deemed as AFK
* The buttons Anti-AFK will press
* How long Anti-AFK will hold the buttons
* Mouse coordinates to move the mouse to (For direct X game input only, higher value is further from the crosshair)
