# Anti-AFK is almost complete
Functionality is finished but compatibility with other systems is being tested

# Anti-AFK
A configurable program that can execute buttons and move your mouse when you are inactive to trick AFK punishing systems into thinking that you are active when you actually aren't. 

Anti-AFK can detect when you're inactive for the selected window even if you are alt tabbed doing stuff in the background and can still apply activity in it. 

While there is no guarantee that Anti-AFK is Anti-Cheat proof, it is guaranteed that keyboard and mouse inputs will seem natural and will look like someone did them manually.
